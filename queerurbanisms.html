	    	Samuel R. Delany reminds us that queerness, a complex social construct like race or religion cannot “come into being without their attendant constructed institutions”. “The freedom to “be” “gay” without the freedom to choose to partake of these institutions is just as meaningless as the freedom to “be””.

		<p>
	    	What can we learn from these spaces that have grown outside the knowledge of the dominant order where much of contemporary queer subjectivity emerges from? How can the social architectures of these institutions inform radical futures that transcend the capitalist imaginary of the techno utopian city of the future? How can these structures orient relations that facilitate solidarity amongst different groups

	    	<a href="www.emilio.click">Emilio Martínez Poppe</a> and <a href="https://www.multiplecities.org/home/2018/4/13/art-democracy">Addison Vawters</a> met while working together alongside anti-displacement coalitions in the Lower East Side partnering artists and cultural workers with community organizing initiatives. In this work Emilio and Addison found a shared concern for the displacement of the last NYC queer spaces left over from a pre-AIDS crisis era. They are developing a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EEPkVNx6HDlv9__7cy9IytmLBlavayJh5BYs_CLBR9E/edit?usp=sharing">syllabus</a> for a co-learning class in spring 2019 and creating projects in response to the erasure of queer spaces and culture.
