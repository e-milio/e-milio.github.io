            Emilio Martínez Poppe is a transdisciplinary artist working across sculpture, installation, video, performance, participatory projects, and research based collaborative projects. Their practice evokes lived legacies of belonging as resistance to the gentrification of bodies, identities, public spaces, and intimacies. Their design work considers forms of knowledge exchange and how the interfaces that host these movements affect the ways in which groups work together. These projects include collaborations with community organizers, local non-profits, artists, and other specialists moving forward issues of access and claims to space through an anti-displacement framework. Emilio is an MFA candidate at The University of Pennsylvania and a member of BFAMFAPhD. They earned a BFA from The Cooper Union School of Art and was a recipient of the SOMA+CU 2016 Scholarship for research in Mexico City. Emilio has exhibited their work at the Queens Museum, CUE Art Foundation, and Flux Factory; and the Gerrit Rietveld Academie, and Vlaams Cultuurhuis de Brakke Grond, in Amsterdam, NL. They have been an artist in residence at Abrons Arts Center, and Pratt Institute; a Fellow at The Laundromat Project; and a member of NEW INC at the New Museum.
