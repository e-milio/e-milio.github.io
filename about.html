        <h2>Bio</h2>
          <p>
            Emilio Martínez Poppe is a New York based visual artist working in sculpture, installation, video, performance, web design, and participatory projects. Their work explores forms of knowledge exchange and how the interfaces that host these movements affect the ways in which groups work together. Emilio earned a BFA from The Cooper Union School of Art and was a recipient of the SOMA+CU 2016 Scholarship for research in Mexico City. Emilio has exhibited their work at the Queens Museum, CUE Art Foundation, Flux Factory, The Cooper Union, and Pratt Institute in New York; Framer Framed, Side Room, the Gerrit Rietveld Academie, and Vlaams Cultuurhuis de Brakke Grond, in Amsterdam, NL. They have been an artist in residence at Pratt Institute’s Project Third, a participant in the EmergeNYC program at the Hemispheric Institute of Performance and Politics, a Create Change Fellow at The Laundromat Project, and a member of NEW INC at the New Museum. Emilio is currently enrolled in The Interdisciplinary Art and Theory Program and is a member of BFAMFAPhD.
