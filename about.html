            Emilio Martínez Poppe is a transdisciplinary artist working across installation, performance, video, and web-design. My work evokes lived legacies of belonging as resistance to the gentrification of bodies, identities, public spaces, and intimacies. Emilio earned a BFA from The Cooper Union School of Art and was a recipient of the SOMA+CU 2016 Scholarship for research in Mexico City. Emilio has exhibited their work at the Queens Museum, CUE Art Foundation, Flux Factory, The Cooper Union, and Pratt Institute in New York; Framer Framed, Side Room, the Gerrit Rietveld Academie, and Vlaams Cultuurhuis de Brakke Grond, in Amsterdam, NL. They have been an artist in residence at Pratt Institute’s Project Third, a participant in the EmergeNYC program at the Hemispheric Institute of Performance and Politics, a Create Change Fellow at The Laundromat Project, and a member of NEW INC at the New Museum. Emilio is currently an artist in residence at Abrons Arts Center and is enrolled in The Interdisciplinary Art and Theory Program. Emilio is a member of BFAMFAPhD.
