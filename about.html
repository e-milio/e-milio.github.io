            Emilio Martínez Poppe is an artist working across installation, performance, participatory projects, and research-based collaborative projects. Their work engages lived and speculative legacies of belonging through their spatial-linguistic formations. Emilio earned a BFA from The Cooper Union School of Art and was a recipient of the SOMA+CU 2016 Scholarship for research in Mexico City. They have exhibited their work at FIERMAN, the Queens Museum, CUE Art Foundation, and Flux Factory in New York City; the Gerrit Rietveld Academie, and Vlaams Cultuurhuis de Brakke Grond, in Amsterdam; and The William Way LGBT Community Center in Philadelphia. Emilio has been an artist in residence at Abrons Arts Center, and Pratt Institute; a Fellow at The Laundromat Project; and a member of NEW INC at the New Museum. They are currently an MFA-MCP dual degree candidate at the University of Pennsylvania and a member of BFAMFAPhD.
