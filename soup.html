          The first installment of Show and Tell at Cooper Union took place on December fourth at 6:30 pm on the grand staircase of the new academic building. On that night for one hour three individuals, the dean of humanities, a sophomore art student, and a senior engineer, presented to an audience of their peers things that they carefully selected to speak about. During the presentations and the following question and answer sessions, the crowd enjoyed tomato soup. This community building event was a much needed occasion to bridge tense divisions that had formed during the times following the announcement of tuition implementation at The Cooper Union. Show and Tell is designed to be an act of celebrating the most minute things that constitute our singularity, and through this support the development of a rich community.
