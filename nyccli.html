            Fighting to Save our Communities is an informational comic book and poster about the benefits of Community Land Trusts in NYC designed with the Education and Outreach Committee of the <a href="http://nyccli.org">New York City Community Land Initiative</a>. We are working towards producing a folding 32 x 40" print, the side not shown here will have an infographic version of the information shared through narrative in the comic book. We are currently on our fifth version and have been working on this project since August 2014,  we meet twice amonth to share our progress. Stay tuned and visit <a href="http://nyccli.org">NYCCLI's Website</a> for more information about their work
