          <h2>STRIKEing The Pose</h2>
          <p>
            A panel I will be moderating at The Cooper Union Rose Auditorium on August 23rd. Panelists include <a href="http://sarahnicolefrancois.tumblr.com">Sarah Nicole Francois</a>, <a href="http://www.jamaltlewis.com/aboutme/">Jamal T. Lewis</a>, <a href="https://arabellesicardi.contently.com">Arabelle Sicardi</a>, and <a href="https://returnthegayze.com">Alok Vaid-Menon</a>. The panel will question what <i>we mean about fashion</i>.The fashion industry today is governed by excess, unsustainability, and inaccessibility. While the industry continues to exploit creative capital from oppressed communities, the face of fashion remains white, thin, cis, and able-bodied. In this panel we question fashion's turn toward queer and trans models and aesthetics. What does it mean for fashion to notice us? Is this positive representation or incorporation, or both? What role can fashion play in the furthering of our own political imaginations? And what influence do networked platforms offer in reconsidering the economic hierarchies we associate with aesthetic production? Together we explore how creatives navigate style, in all of its manufacturing, distribution, and reception, in this fashion climate of simultaneous hyper visibility and hyper inequality.

          <h2>Of Supply Chains</h2>
          <p>
            Of Supply Chains is a pedagogical tool designed with
            <a href="http://carolinewoolard.com">Caroline Woolard</a> and <a href="http://www.susanjahoda.com">Susan Jahoda</a> of <a href="http://bfamfaphd.com">BFAMFAPhD</a> that can be adapted to various classroom and workshop contexts. The pedagogy traces the life cycle of projects -- the ways materials are sourced, how the labor for producing an artwork is organized, how tools are accessed, how an artwork is subsidized, licensed, promoted, encountered, acquired, and how it finally departs, ready for another life cycle.
