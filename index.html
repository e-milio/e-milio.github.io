          <h2>Of Supply Chains</h2>
          <p>
            <a href="http://http://bfamfaphd.com/cards">Of Supply Chains</a> is an open source text, workbook, and game for undergraduate and graduate classes of art and design that allows a wide range of choices for organizing work, compensating workers, and producing projects to become visible and open to contestation. Of Supply Chains can be used in classroom, exhibition, and workshop contexts to analyse and reimagine power relationships and support structures in the arts. It offers the vocabulary of supply chains to articulate the politics of production behind any project. This project is a collaboration with <a href="http://carolinewoolard.com">Caroline Woolard</a> and <a href="http://www.susanjahoda.com">Susan Jahoda</a> of <a href="http://bfamfaphd.com">BFAMFAPhD</a>.

          <h2>Intro to Constructed Garments</h2>
          <p>
            In 2015 I created an extracurricular class at The Cooper Union with <a href="http://www.antilika.net">Lika Volkova</a>. The class was created to provide resources for students seeking an introduction into garment construction, from patternÂ­making to sewing. It also serves as a space for group reflection on individual projects. The workshop, which meets for twelve weeks a semester, also includes lectures on garment history, from ancient Greece through the present. These lectures built on the student&#8217;s existing knowledge of western history taught in other survey classes. They revealed the ways that shifting politics, economics and architecture affected social views on the body, how people dress themselves and construct clothing. A showcase of the student&#8217;s work was included in the <a href="http://cooper.edu/events-and-exhibitions/exhibitions/end-year-show-2016">Cooper Union 2016 EOYS</a>
