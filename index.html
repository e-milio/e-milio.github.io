          <h2>Of Supply Chains</h2>
          <p>
            Of Supply Chains is a pedagogical tool designed with
            <a href="http://carolinewoolard.com">Caroline Woolard</a> and <a href="http://www.susanjahoda.com">Susan Jahoda</a> of <a href="http://bfamfaphd.com">BFAMFAPhD</a> that can be adapted to various classroom and workshop contexts. The pedagogy traces the life cycle of projects -- the ways materials are sourced, how the labor for producing an artwork is organized, how tools are accessed, how an artwork is subsidized, licensed, promoted, encountered, acquired, and how it finally departs, ready for another life cycle.  Download a 
            <a href="http://www.bfamfaphd.com">PDF</a> of the latest text or watch this 
            <a href="https://vimeo.com/154115948">video</a> we made introducing the tool.
