          <h2>Ten Leaps: A Lexicon for Art Education</h2>
          <p>
            I've been working closely with with <a href="http://carolinewoolard.com">Caroline Woolard</a> and <a href="http://www.susanjahoda.com">Susan Jahoda</a> of <a href="http://bfamfaphd.com">BFAMFAPhD</a> for over a year as the designer of <i><a href="http://bfamfaphd.com/project/tenleaps/">Ten Leaps: A Lexicon for Art Education</a></i>. The project takes the form of an open source text, workbook, and card game for undergraduate and graduate classes of art and design that allows a wide range of choices for organizing work, compensating workers, and producing projects to become visible and open to contestation. <i>Ten Leaps</i> can be used in classroom, exhibition, and workshop contexts to analyse and reimagine power relationships and support structures in the arts. It offers the vocabulary of supply chains to articulate the politics of production behind any project. Our project is included in <a href="http://cueartfoundation.org/the-visible-hand/"><i>The Visible Hand</i></a> at CUE Art Foundation and can be seen through February 15.

          <h2>Diagrams</h2>

            I tend to learn about complex systems or concepts by making diagrams of them. <br> <a href="https://emilio.click/diagrams">This is where I share them</a>.

          <h2>STRIKE The Pose</h2>
          <p>
            What do we do about fashion? The fashion industry today is governed by excess, unsustainability, and inaccessibility. While the industry continues to exploit creative capital from oppressed communities, the face of fashion remains white, thin, cis, and able-bodied. In this panel we question fashion&#8217;s turn toward queer and trans models and aesthetics. What does it mean for fashion to notice us? Is this positive representation or incorporation, or both? What role can fashion play in the furthering of our own political imaginations? And what influence do networked platforms offer in reconsidering the economic hierarchies we associate with aesthetic production? Together we explore how creatives navigate style&#x2014;in all of its manufacturing, distribution, and reception&#x2014;in this fashion climate of simultaneous hyper visibility and hyper inequality. <br> This was a panel I organized and moderated at The Cooper Union Rose Auditorium on August 23rd. Panelists include <a href="http://sarahnicolefrancois.tumblr.com">Sarah Nicole Francois</a>, <a href="http://www.jamaltlewis.com/aboutme/">Jamal T. Lewis</a>, <a href="https://arabellesicardi.contently.com">Arabelle Sicardi</a>, and <a href="https://returnthegayze.com">Alok Vaid-Menon</a>. I also designed the poster.

          <h2>Intro to Constructed Garments</h2>
          <p>
            In 2015 I created an extracurricular class at The Cooper Union with <a href="http://www.antilika.net">Lika Volkova</a>. The class was created to provide resources for students seeking an introduction into garment construction, from patternmaking to sewing. It also serves as a space for group reflection on individual projects. The workshop, which meets for twelve weeks a semester, also includes lectures on garment history, from ancient Greece through the present. These lectures built on the student&#8217;s existing knowledge of western history taught in other survey classes. They revealed the ways that shifting politics, economics and architecture affected social views on the body, how people dress themselves and construct clothing. A showcase of the student&#8217;s work was included in the <a href="http://cooper.edu/events-and-exhibitions/exhibitions/end-year-show-2016">Cooper Union 2016 EOYS</a>. I also designed our poster and am working on a forthcoming textbook.
