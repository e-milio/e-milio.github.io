          <h2>Open Credits</h2>
          <p>
           	Open Credits is an interactive platform for audiences to engage with notions of authorship and crediting in exhibition and performance contexts. The platform is flexible and can be installed in a variety of  arts settings and exhibition spaces. The installation will include a computer set up where participants can <a href="http://iftheyreok.info/write">write</a> the way in which they were involved; installing work, visiting the space, curating, exhibiting, etc. This content will then be sorted into a standard <a href="http://iftheyreok.info">film credit format</a> and will be projected into the exhibition space in a way that intervenes with the architecture. The first installment of the platform was at the exhbition <i>If They're OK</i>.

          <h2>Ways of Being</h2>
          <p>
            I've been working closely with <a href="http://carolinewoolard.com">Caroline Woolard</a> and <a href="http://www.susanjahoda.com">Susan Jahoda</a> of <a href="http://bfamfaphd.com">BFAMFAPhD</a> for over two years as the designer of <i><a href="http://bfamfaphd.com/project/ways-of-being/">Ways of Being</a></i>. <i>Ways of Being</i> is a multi-platform pedagogical project which offers practices of collaboration, contemplation, and social-ecological analysis for visual artists. <i>Ways of Being</i> is for arts educators who want to connect art to economy; for students who want to make artworks that reflect the conditions of their own production. <i>Ways of Being</i> is a book, a series of videos, a deck of cards, and an interactive website with freely downloadable content. Our project was included in <a href="http://cueartfoundation.org/the-visible-hand/"><i>The Visible Hand</i></a> at CUE Art Foundation. We are going to be in residence at Pratt Institute's <a href="https://commons.pratt.edu/prattfinearts/project-third/"><i>Project Third</i> Teaching Artist Residency this summer.</a>

          <h2>The Colon Arts</h2>
          <p>
            I've had an ongoing interest in representations and research done into digestive health and practices. I'm interested in ways of exploding and questioning the taboos around digestion and notions of sanitation. I've started to compile a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IES4AWDdVdrbwqOmNPVswRWuFpv6XyswjdsKEe5AfAs/edit?usp=sharing">living  directory</a> of contemporary art which opens these conversations through form, participation, and performance. Essay forthcoming.

          <h2>Scarecrows in the Garden</h2>
          <p>
            From July to September 2017 I worked with <a href="http://www.stephaniealvarado.com/">Stephanie Alvarado</a>, <a href="https://www.nikomeh.com//">Nikomeh Anderson</a>, <a href="https://www.aletheapace.com/">Alethea Pace</a>, and <a href="http://artoftijay.com/">Tijay Mohammed</a>, as the Laundromat Project Create Change Fellows in the Bronx. Along with eight young artists from Kelly Street we built five scarecrows for the Kelly Street Community Garden as a means to scare away pests and protect a community resource. On September 16th we gathered for a story circle and workshop led by Elizabeth Rossi (another CC Fellow) to gather shared values that can be found on Kelly street. The kids spoke to the strength of their community and they shared this at the public unveiling of the scarecrows on the LP Field Day.

          <h2>Diagrams</h2>
          <p>
            I tend to learn about complex systems or concepts by making diagrams of them. <br> <a href="https://emilio.click/diagrams">This is where I share them</a>.

          <h2>Sidreoom Manifesto</h2>
          <p>
           <a href="https://http://sideroom.org">People People</a> is a “video manifesto” based off of the written version developed by <a href="https://framerframed.nl/en/mensen/amal-alhaag/">Amal Alhaag</a> and <a href="http://mariaguggenbichler.xyz/">Maria Guggenbichler</a> commissioned for the closing of The Side Room (and its website) – a feminist art space in Amsterdam which was built out of the side room of a brewery called Butcher's Tears. The Side Room still runs its programs like the DJ Workshop for Women in different spaces across Europe.

          <h2>STRIKE The Pose</h2>
          <p>
            What do we do about fashion? The fashion industry today is governed by excess, unsustainability, and inaccessibility. While the industry continues to exploit creative capital from oppressed communities, the face of fashion remains white, thin, cis, and able-bodied. In this panel we question fashion&#8217;s turn toward queer and trans models and aesthetics. What does it mean for fashion to notice us? Is this positive representation or incorporation, or both? What role can fashion play in the furthering of our own political imaginations? And what influence do networked platforms offer in reconsidering the economic hierarchies we associate with aesthetic production? Together we explore how creatives navigate style&#x2014;in all of its manufacturing, distribution, and reception&#x2014;in this fashion climate of simultaneous hyper visibility and hyper inequality. <br> This was a panel I organized and moderated at The Cooper Union Rose Auditorium on August 23rd. Panelists include <a href="http://sarahnicolefrancois.tumblr.com">Sarah Nicole Francois</a>, <a href="http://www.jamaltlewis.com/aboutme/">Jamal T. Lewis</a>, <a href="https://arabellesicardi.contently.com">Arabelle Sicardi</a>, and <a href="https://returnthegayze.com">Alok Vaid-Menon</a>. I also designed the poster.

          <h2>Intro to Constructed Garments</h2>
          <p>
            In 2015 I created an extracurricular class at The Cooper Union with <a href="http://www.antilika.net">Lika Volkova</a>. The class was created to provide resources for students seeking an introduction into garment construction, from patternmaking to sewing. It also serves as a space for group reflection on individual projects. The workshop, which meets for twelve weeks a semester, also includes lectures on garment history, from ancient Greece through the present. These lectures built on the student&#8217;s existing knowledge of western history taught in other survey classes. They revealed the ways that shifting politics, economics and architecture affected social views on the body, how people dress themselves and construct clothing. A showcase of the student&#8217;s work was included in the <a href="http://cooper.edu/events-and-exhibitions/exhibitions/end-year-show-2016">Cooper Union 2016 EOYS</a>. I also designed our poster and am working on a forthcoming textbook.
